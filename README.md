 The Note Output Simulator is a program developed in C ++ to simulate the notes output from an ATM based on the user's inserted withdrawal value. This document provides an overview of program operation including describing its features, usage requirements, and information on the use license.

 The Note Output Simulator is a simple program that allows the user to insert a value to be drawn into the ATM and simulates the amount of notes of each value that would be issued by the ATM for this withdrawal value. The program uses a function to separate the amount of notes by its value (50, 20, 10 and 5) and displays this information to the user.

## **Use Requirements:**
### **System Requirements:**
C ++ compiler installed (eg G ++)

C ++ compiler compatible operating system

### **Compilation and Execution:**
Open the terminal or command prompt.

Browse to the directory where the program of the program “Simulator_Notas.CPP” is located.

Compile the program by typing the following command

**_g ++ simulator_notas.cpp -o./simulator_Notas_**

Run the newly compiled program by typing the following command:

**_./Simulator_Notes_**

### **Use:**

Upon running the program it will be asked to enter the amount to be removed from the ATM.
Enter the desired value and press ENTER.
The program will simulate the output of the ATM from the inserted value and will also display the amount of notes of each value (50, 20, 10, 5 and also 2).
